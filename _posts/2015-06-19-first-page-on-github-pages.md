# A bit about how I view myself today.
I have had a tendency to get involved in quite a few different things throughout my life.  I do what I can to help enable people to accomplish their goals clean up their problems and learn from their mistakes.  I learn what I can from every experience and try to avoid repeating mistakes as much as possible.  I always try to resolve systemic issues rather than waste time repeatedly resolving the same symptomatic ones.
